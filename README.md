# MVP-Builder-Router, Unit Test

Example of MVP + Router + Builder Architecture
2 view: List and Detail, Navigation Controller
Unit Test example implemented
Real URL session, JSON parsing
No Storyboard in code view instantiation using xib

Algorithm:
- getting JSON
- parsing
- list view
- select comment
- view detail

This project demonstrates the use of MVP + Router + Builder Architecture in Swift. 

It consists of two views: a list view and a detail view, connected by a navigation controller. The list view displays a list of comments fetched from a JSON API using a real URL session. The detail view shows the details of a selected comment body. 

The project does not use storyboard, but instead creates the views programmatically using xib files. The project also uses the router and builder patterns to handle the navigation and dependency injection between the views and the presenter. The project aims to show how to implement a clean and modular architecture in Swift using best practices and design principles.
